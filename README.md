# Containers - Docker üê≥
Advantages of using containers:
- Containers are light (unlike virtual machines)
- Portable
- Easy to reuse
- Each container is independent
- Fast Release
- Provides an eficient usage of resources

Many things, like a Data Base, a OS, a program can be containerized. We connect to a host (kernel of the OS) instead of connecting to the OS itself.

It is important to use Containers because they have several advantages (like mentioned above) compared to other tools like virtual machines, so it can improve performance in building projects.

Maintenability and deployment, for example, can be enhanced by using containers, as they are also small, and easy to manage.
